Ever since Mint shut down, there's not a great way to track your personal finances (for free). I've reverted to manually collecting data and maintaining spreadsheets. But downloading transaction history from bank sites is pretty tedious. This is a collection of scripts in an attempt to automate that away.

After you get the raw CSV data, you'll need to work it into a format that's uniform and helpful to you.

Also, since this is browser automation, there's a chance that UI updates will break everything. If you run into this, feel free to submit a pull request!

Cheers
